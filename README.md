# Diabetes-Prediction-System-with-Deployment
In this project, we developed and deployed a diabetes prediction model with a focus on creating a user-friendly Web interface . The objective is to build a predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health parameters.
